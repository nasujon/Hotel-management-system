In this a C++ program is discussed to manage the Hospital Management System. Given data of Hospitals with the name of hospital, contact and doctors and patients below are the functionalities that needed to be implemented:


Design a Hospital Management System using 
classes, 
member functions, 
member variables, 
inheritances, 
polymorphisms

Functions Supported:

Print Hospital DATA
Print Patients data
SORT BY Beds Price
SORT BY Available Beds
SORT BY NAME
SORT BY Rating and reviews
Print hospital of any specific city

The important functions in the program:

PrintHospitalData() : It will print all the hospitals data.
PrintPatientData() : It will print all the hospitals data.
SortHospitalByName(): Sort all the hospitals from name
SortHospitalByRating(): Sort hospitals according to rating
SortByBedsAvailable() : Sort hospitals according to beds available
SortByBedsPrice(): Sort hospitals according to the minimum price.

Approach:

Create classes for both the Hospital dataset and Patient data.
Initialize variables that store Hospital dataset and Patient data.
Create Objects for hospitals and Patient classes that access the Hospital dataset and Patient data.
use two arrays that hold the Hospital dataset and Patient data.
Implement the given functionality as shown below.
Below is the implementation of the above approach.
